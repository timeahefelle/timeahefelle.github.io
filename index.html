                    I am a legal service professional having experience both in private and public sector. In my former positions I have managed
                    to adapt quickly at all times, learning something new and coping with unexpected situations have always
                    been a challenge that still keeps me moving further. I have experience not only in Compliance, but also
                    in Corporate Law, legal representation, negotiation and Labor Law.
